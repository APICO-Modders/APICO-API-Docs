# APICO-API-Docs

This is the source for the main API documentation page on the wiki (https://wiki.apico.buzz/wiki/Modding_API)

Only Wiki Admins can edit this page directly on the Wiki, but this is here to let people request changes/issues with the documentation.
Updating this repo does not update the Wiki.
